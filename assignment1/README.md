I delete the dataset and some details to reduce the data downloaded. You can get these things by run the top code in the jupter(provided). So make sure your computer can get in WIFI. If you want to run in own computer, please make sure your computer install the program and the enviroment, python3.x and conda or jupter, it depends on how you want to run it.

And I answered the inline questions in Chinese, and provied some links to chinese blogs.And I got some errors running file `collectSubmission.sh` about the `Q5:feature`.But that makes no difference, so I don't run the last block of code in 'feature.ipnb'.

我删除了数据集和一些细节，以便减少下载的数据。您可以通过运行jupter(提供)中的顶部代码来获得这些东西。所以确保你的电脑能接入WIFI。如果你想在自己的计算机上运行，请确保你的计算机安装了程序和环境，即python3.X和conda或者jupter，这取决于你想怎么运行它。

我用中文回答了内联问题，并提供了一些中文博客的链接。我在运行文件`collectSubmission.sh`时发生错误，但这没有什么影响，所有没有运行`feature.ipnb`的最后一个代码块。
