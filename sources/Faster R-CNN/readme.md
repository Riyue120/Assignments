I made a example of Faster R-cnn in the link[https://www.kaggle.com/code/zshiming/faster-r-cnn/edit].
If you want to use this notebook, you should notice the input datasets. I add two datasets,"/kaggle/input/mobilenet-v2/mobilenet_v2.pth" and "/kaggle/input/pascal-voc-2012".
You can add the first dataset in my Dataset, the second in the public dataset PASCAL VOC 2012.
